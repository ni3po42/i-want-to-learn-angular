Download Node from:  
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Next Steps

If you grabbed the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) while it was on sale, run through the first couple sections to get a feel for the framework. The course as a whole is a comprehensive introduction, but it's quite large and will take some time.

## Otherwise...

Make your first app!:  
```ng new my-first-app```  
Build and run it with:  
```ng serve```  

In lieu of the Udemy course, follow one of these other resources for guidance:

And her intermediate follow-ups:

## Join the Fray

If you want to join the mish-mash collaborative project, find it [here](https://github.com/tabrown3/i-want-to-learn-angular)  

You can clone the project right away, but you won't be able to push changes till I've added your GitHub username or email address to the whitelist.  

Clone with:  
```git clone https://github.com/tabrown3/i-want-to-learn-angular```  
Alternatively set the repo as upstream:  
```git remote add upstream https://github.com/tabrown3/i-want-to-learn-angular```  

If you want to submit a change but don't have permissions yet, you can instead fork and submit a pull request. Otherwise, do the following:  
```git push origin master```  

Once you have the project, don't forget to perform ```npm install```, then you can build and run with ```ng serve```. By default, the Angular CLI dev server serves at localhost:4200

If the thought of using one branch makes you cringe, good. Make and manage your own branch if you like, or simply use master. It shouldn't matter. I am very much a git novice, so if you are having trouble with the above steps, reach out to me or one of the more informed group members for assistance.

If you need a RESTful service to ping off of and don't feel like setting up your own, try one of these free, public APIs:

I will be using the Space Agency API for my tab on the site.
